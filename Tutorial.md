# Basic Tutorial

*A condensed version of the tutorial is also available in-game with `/impostor tutorial`.*

This is a quick guide on how to play GreatImpostor. If you played the base game before, most of this will be familiar.

## Starting the game

Make sure the plugin has been set up before starting your first game. Check the setup guide for details.

Command: `/impostor start`. For multiple impostors, use `/impostor start 2`, `/impostor start 3`, etc.

## Playing as a crewmate

Finish your tasks and try to vote out the impostor(s)!

- Your tasks are shown on the 4 pieces of glass in your inventory.
  - Crewmates automatically win if all tasks are completed. You can see the progress right above your hotbar where it says "Total Tasks Completed".
- Right click with the horn while standing next to a dead body to report it.
- You can also call an emergency meeting by using the sign in the center of the map.
- Impostors have access to 4 sabotages:
  - Lights: Your vision is reduced and you will be unable to sprint. Fix it at the panel in electrical.
  - Comms: You cannot see task progress and cannot call meetings. Fix it at the panel in communications.
  - O2: You must fix two panels in oxygen and admin to stop it. Failure to fix the sabotage within the time allowed results in all crewmates' deaths.
  - Reactor meltdown: Two crewmates must activate the panels in reactor to stop it. Failure to fix the sabotage within the time allowed results in all crewmates' deaths.
- When a meeting is called, you'll have a certain amount of time to discuss and vote.
  - The remaining time is shown above your hotbar.
  - Vote using `/vote <name>` or `/vote skip` to vote to skip. You can change your vote as many times as you want before the meeting ends by running the command again.

Advanced strategies:

- The medbay scan task is a visual task. If you see someone doing it, they are a crewmate. If you have it, you can also prove to others that you are a crewmate.
- Each player can only call a certain number of meetings per game (can be changed by server admins, by default it's 1 per game). Use them wisely!
- You can view the security cameras in the security room. You can sometimes catch an impostor doing something suspicious!

## Playing as an impostor

Kill off the crewmates while remaining undetected and sabotage their progress!

- Press 6 to change the sabotage you want to activate. Your currently selected sabotage is shown above your hotbar. (You can change the key from the default of 6 by changing the hotkey for your 6th hotbar slot.)
- Press 7 to activate the currently selected sabotage.
- Press shift over a vent to enter it. Then press space to move to different vents and shift again to exit. Your cooldowns do not go down while in vents.
- Kill a crewmate by hitting them with your sword. You can safely punch them without killing them.
- Unlike in the main game, you can actually open the task menus while playing as an impostor. You still can't do visual tasks, though.
