# GreatImpostor

The simple, easy-to-use, and clean Minecraft Among Us.

## Features

If it's in the main game, we probably have it too! Here are some of the highlights:

**Tasks in GUI menus** (show unlock manifolds)


**Sabotages** (show going to O2 & fixing O2)


**Easily & seamlessly activate sabotages by hotkeying**


**Fast venting**


**Security cameras**  
*A fake player is spawned in the security room so the impostor can still kill crewmates if they are watching the cameras!*


**Meetings & voting** (show emergency meeting + vote from player's POV + *maybe also show the meeting ending if there's space & the gif isn't too long*)


**Killing & dead bodies** (show kill + self report + meeting start)


**Visual tasks** (show medbay scan from second player's POV)


**And more!**
- Game start screen showing IMPOSTOR
- Crewmate checking their tasks
- Fix lights sabotage gif from crewmate POV
